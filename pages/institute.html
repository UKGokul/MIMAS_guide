    <h1>Institute & People</h1>
    <p class="muted">
      This project is connected to the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Kühlungsborn —
      with a focus on the Department of Optical Soundings and Sounding Rockets.

      <h2>Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP)</h2>
      <p>
        The IAP investigates processes in the middle and upper atmosphere, with particular emphasis on the
        stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere (MLT). The MLT region forms a critical link between
        the troposphere (the “weather” layer) and near-space environments relevant for low-Earth-orbiting satellites.

      <h2>Department: Optical Soundings & Sounding Rockets</h2>
      <p>
        The main objectives of the Department of Optical Soundings and Sounding Rockets are ground-based optical
        soundings of the middle and upper atmosphere (and, in part, the troposphere), and the scientific interpretation
        of processes in these regions. The core experimental method is lidar
        (<b>LI</b>ght <b>D</b>etection <b>A</b>nd <b>R</b>anging), enabling active, long-term, ground-based observations of atmospheric
        parameters and constituents across approximately <b>0–120 km</b> altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complementary measurements are obtained using <b>in-situ detectors</b> on stratospheric balloons and
        sounding rockets. A further key goal is the <b>modelling and theoretical interpretation</b> of the
        processes observed experimentally — where models like MIMAS play an important role.

      <h2>Research Focus Areas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Exploration of the middle atmosphere (MLT):</b>
          Remote sensing is essential in this altitude range; laser-based lidar systems provide key observations
          alongside occasional rocket in-situ measurements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Temperature and wind soundings:</b>
          Measurements across mid-latitudes, the Arctic, and Antarctica to quantify variability and long-term change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Noctilucent clouds (NLC):</b>
          NLCs serve as a sensitive tracer of temperatures in the ~80–90 km region and reveal fine-scale dynamics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Metal layers and trace gases:</b>
          Studies of chemistry and dynamics in the MLT using observations of metallic layers and other species.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Vertical Coupling</h2>
      <p>
        Atmospheric layers are dynamically coupled by waves propagating horizontally and vertically. As a result,
        changes in the troposphere and stratosphere can influence the mesosphere and thermosphere — and vice versa.
        Understanding the middle and upper atmosphere therefore also supports improved understanding of weather,
        climate variability, and long-term change.

        <li><b>Gravity waves:</b> effects in wind, temperature, and trace-gas distributions</li>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Long-Term Change & NLC Trends</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change affects not only the lower atmosphere but also the middle atmosphere. In the mesosphere,
        increasing carbon dioxide can lead to a <b>cooling effect</b>. The department aims to understand
        the magnitude of these changes, regional differences, and their influence on dynamics and trace-gas distributions.
